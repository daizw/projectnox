= Introduction =

In Project NoX an IM system (I call it NoX) will be implemented.
Nox is based on JXTA, and will be developed in Java.

= Details =

As a P2P IM system, *NoX* will make you feel free to do these things:
  * *chat* with your friends(_send/receive text/picture-contained/mixed-up messages to/from your friends_);

  * chat with some friends in a _chatroom_;

  * *share* files with your friends;

  * play online *games*(exp. _chess/chinese cheess/tic-tac-toe_, etc) with your friends.

*Besides these*, if anyone has any great ideas, please just let me know and let's talk about it!
